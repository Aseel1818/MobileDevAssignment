in this assignment  I had  create  4 classes  , one for route and it has a list of objects of class routers , and  class routers that include an int ,
the third class I made it for user input it includes 2 methods ,one for add a new route and I made it by add a new object of type Route to the list of objects , then I declare an int vaiable
that repesent the number of routers and I create a for loop to let user enter the routers .

for the second method which is used to add a router into a current route ,I put input value for the value of the router ,then I use add function to add it to the object list ,

in the last class I just try to use asynchronous method with help from internet  to sum every route seperetly and get the best answer which is the router that have the minimum value

I used parallelism because we dealing with a CPU-bound operation which is summing values,Parallel  support limiting the number of threads.
