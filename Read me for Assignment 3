in this assignment I create 3 folders :
1- Mdel
2-ModelView
3-View


1- Folder Model :
have 3 classes of type c#

1. one for user 
2. second for admin 
3. third for staff

And I put the properities of each one of these classes,

then I create a c# class inside   Model View Folder and I put in it the operations that user  can do like ( add staff object,add admin object,add user object,update object ,delete object )
And I store objects in observable collection .

  Next , I declare an exceptions for the 3  required situations :
  a. User enters invald data for example, id is int , name is string .. etc
b. User tries to add a new user with a duplicate id.
c. User tries to update/delete a user that is not found.

So the program will throw exception when these situations are occured :

a- for invalid data exception I check the type of arguments if it's valid and the same like parameter type.
b-for duplicate id I check if the observable colllection have the same id that will pass .
c-for update and delete a not found user ,I check if the passed id does not match any id from the collection it will throw an exception.


finally :
1- I create a c# class inside view folder , that have a method to print all exceptions occures in the program.
2-I try to use the delegate event to listen to the changes happend in the system (add,update and delete objects).
